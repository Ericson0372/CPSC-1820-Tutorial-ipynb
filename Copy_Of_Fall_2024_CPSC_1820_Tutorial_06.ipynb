    "\n",
    "*Answer:* The code works by definition the logic within the function called \"istransitive\" taking in set as a data structure, to which each elements are ordered pairs as defined in the assignment of the set variable called `R`. Within the first line of the function, it is looping through the Set `R`, iterating through the ordered pairs. It then goes into a nested loop which iterates the ordered pairs again the same fashion as the first loop. Within the nested loop, it prints the two respective ordered pairs at its current index, comparing variable `b` to `c`, which is intended to compare the first ordered pair's second value to the second ordered pair's first value. It also prints the ordered pair (a,d) which is intended to compare the same fashion as previously described, but instead applies to the first and the fourth values. The next line checks that if b is the same as c and the ordered pair `(a,d)` is not in the relation set, then it returns False, implying that the set relation is not transitive. If the condition is the opposite, then it exits out of the nested loop and returns True. However, I do not believe that function correctly evalues that the set relation is transitive. In the printed output, the function return true when evaluating (1,2) and (2,3), but (1,3) is in the relation set, so this contradicts the intent of the function."
